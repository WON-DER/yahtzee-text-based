# yahtzee-text-based
Recreating Yahtzee in a text-based fashion. This is my first personal python project and has helped tie together what I've been practicing and reading about relating to OOP, Classes, inheritance as well as importing my own modules.
This project starts from the yahtzee.py file and first asks the user how many players are there (1 or 2) at the moment.
